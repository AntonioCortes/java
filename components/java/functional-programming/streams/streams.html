TODO: parallel y parallelstream!, me parece que con arrays no se puede tabajar en paralelo, CONSULTAR!!!!

<h2></h2>

Any stream in Java can easily be transformed from sequential to parallel.

We can achieve this by adding the parallel method to a sequential stream or by creating a stream using the parallelStream method of a collection:

List<Integer> listOfNumbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
listOfNumbers.parallelStream().forEach(number ->
    System.out.println(number + " " + Thread.currentThread().getName())
);
Copy
Parallel streams enable us to execute code in parallel on separate cores. The final result is the combination of each individual outcome.

However, the order of execution is out of our control. It may change every time we run the program:

4 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3
2 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-5
1 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-7
3 main
